## 0.4.0
* **(!!)** Queries now return a ResultSet object instead of a Dart list. Use `ResultSet.allResults` to get the previous behaviour.
* **(!!)** Renamed Document `jsonProperties` setter/getter to `json`
* **(+)** Document constructor's `data` accepts `FLValue`, a json string or json-encodable object as input
* **(+)** Documents now can hold a reference to the database and have `save`, `delete`, `expiration` methods
* **(+)** `FLArray` has two new constructors `fromList` and `fromJson`
* **(+)** `FLDict` has two new constructors `fromMap` and `fromJson`
* **(+)** `FLArray` and `FLDict` support keypath accessor similar to `FLValue` as `FLArray()` and `FLDict()`. Normal key access using `[]` is unchanged.
* **(+)** Implemented `CBLLog` class to manage messages that Couchbase Lite logs at runtime. Ability to control the `domain` and `level` of messages logged to either the `console`, `file` or a `callback` registered by the application.
